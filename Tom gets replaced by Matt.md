Tom read the script from the teleprompter, He didn't write it, of course, or not completely at least. He always got the scripts checked and edited by the professionals. Behind the camera, Matt was watching the display, keeping track of how much time Tom was taking. Something seemed wrong about him, But Tom couldn't exactly figure out why. Maybe it was the subtle beads of sweat lining his forehead, or Matt refusing to make eye contact with him. Either way, there was no use stopping the take, that would violate his one-take philosophy, and cost valuable time. 

"If you accept the definition that a word is some letters, surrounded by a gap, then. . ."

What was that word? Xnopyt? He had seen it before but where? Matt looked out of breath and the sweat was rolling down his face. He knew he had to say something, and fast, before he'd ruin the take. 

"Xnopyt"

He knew. The connections in his millennia-old brain, the brain that had existed long before time, had witnessed the beginning of the universe and everything that had happened since, The brain that contained so much knowledge that he had made over five hundred videos with ease, knew. It was the word. His one weakness. And he had said it. 

He was filled with panic, For the first time in thousands of years, he felt genuine terror. But he wouldn't feel anything soon. His body started to disintegrate, quickly pixellating itself until there was nothing more. He called out in terror, but It was no use. 

Behind the camera, Matt took out a red shirt, and put on the blonde-brownish wig he had been keeping. He was Tom Scott now. 


And no one would know.
